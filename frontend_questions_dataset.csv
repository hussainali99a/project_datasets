Describe how Webpack and Babel work together in the modern JS build process.,"Webpack bundles modules, while Babel transpiles modern JavaScript into backward-compatible code."
What are the pros and cons of micro-frontends? How would you implement them?,"Pros: independent deployment, scalability. Cons: complexity, potential performance issues. Implement using module federation, iframes, or custom elements."
How does tree shaking work in modern JavaScript bundlers?,"Tree shaking eliminates unused code during the bundling process, reducing final bundle size."
Explain content security policy (CSP) and how you would implement it in a frontend app.,CSP is a security feature to prevent XSS attacks. Implement via HTTP headers or meta tags to restrict resource loading.
What is Critical Rendering Path? How would you optimize it for performance?,"CRP is the sequence of steps to render content on screen. Optimize by minimizing CSS/JS, inlining critical CSS, and lazy-loading assets."
"How do you handle long lists efficiently in React (e.g., 10,000+ items)?",Use virtualization libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized` to render only visible items.
Describe lazy loading and code-splitting. How does it improve performance?,"Lazy loading loads resources only when needed. Code-splitting breaks code into smaller chunks, reducing initial load time."
How do service workers enable offline-first web applications?,"Service workers cache assets and intercept network requests, allowing offline access."
What is the difference between hydration and client-side rendering?,Hydration is attaching interactivity to pre-rendered HTML; client-side rendering builds the DOM in-browser entirely.
Explain the impact of CORS in frontend development. How do you resolve related issues?,CORS restricts cross-origin requests. Resolve by setting appropriate CORS headers on the server.
What are controlled vs uncontrolled components in React?,Controlled components have their state managed by React; uncontrolled ones use refs to access the DOM directly.
What is the role of `useMemo` and `useCallback` in React optimization?,"`useMemo` memoizes values, `useCallback` memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders."

What is the role of `aria-*` attributes in accessible web design?,`aria-*` attributes provide additional context for screen readers to enhance accessibility.
Describe Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and how to prevent it in frontend applications.,XSS injects malicious scripts. Prevent with input sanitization and CSP.
What are web accessibility (a11y) best practices for modern websites?,"Use semantic HTML, labels for inputs, keyboard navigation, and ARIA roles."
How do `flexbox` and `grid` differ in layout design?,"Flexbox is one-dimensional (row or column), Grid is two-dimensional (row and column)."
"What is the difference between `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `cookies`?","`localStorage` persists data with no expiration, `sessionStorage` lasts per tab session, cookies are sent with requests."
"What is the use of `contentEditable`, and what should developers be cautious of?",It allows inline editing. Be cautious of security and input handling.
